Project Overview
In this project, we'll predict tomorrow's temperature using historical data. We'll start by downloading a dataset of local weather. This can beto your own location. Then, we'll clean the data and get it ready for machine learning. We'll build a system to make historical predictions. Then, we'll add more predictors to improve the model. We'll end with how to make next-day predictions.

Project Steps

1. Download weather data
2. Clean and graph data
3. Create a testing framework
4. Improve model accuracy
